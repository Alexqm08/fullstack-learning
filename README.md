Welcome to my repository where I document my journey through the Full-Stack Engineer Career Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/).

🎯 **Goal**: Become a proficient full-stack developer by the end of 2025 by mastering front-end and back-end technologies through structured learning and hands-on projects.
